This is a demo of the Rack middleware plugin for WrenchMode

# Setup and Configuration

Copy the config-development.rb.example file
`cp config-development.rb.example config-developmentrb`

Edit the file and add your JWT and protocol/host information. Most likely you'll want `http` for protocol and `localhost:4000` for host.
